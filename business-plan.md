# Business Plan

_noma: a social network for bars and restaurants_

## Venture Overview and Strategic Rationale

### Concept Snapshot

Noma is a mobile-first digital platform designed to unify gastronomic discovery, social interaction, and long-term experience recall into a single, coherent product. In operational terms, the platform enables users to record restaurants and bars they have visited or plan to visit, publish ratings and reviews, curate favorites and lists, and, moreover, follow trusted connections in order to discover places through socially contextualized activity rather than through purely anonymous, utility-driven signals. Consequently, Noma transforms scattered references—typically spread across screenshots, messaging apps, and informal notes—into a persistent and shareable “experience memory,” thereby reducing cognitive overload while improving the quality and trustworthiness of future decisions.

From a venture perspective, Noma is structured around a phased commercialization strategy that prioritizes controlled entry, rapid learning, and disciplined iteration, particularly because early-stage platforms benefit more from validated feedback loops than from premature scale. Therefore, the initial market focus is São Paulo, where venue density and consumer behavior create a high-signal environment for validating discovery patterns, retention drivers, and partnership-based monetization. Although the solution has not yet been commercially launched, the project has already produced a functional MVP, a validated technical architecture, and a structured Go-To-Market plan, which together establish a credible foundation for field validation and progressive expansion.

### The Core Pain and Why It Matters

Urban consumers increasingly depend on digital platforms to find places; however, the act of remembering and organizing meaningful gastronomic experiences remains fragmented and inefficient. In practice, users often leave venues with strong impressions, yet later struggle to recall names, locations, and contextual details, while the references they do retain are typically stored informally and inconsistently, which undermines long-term recall and reduces the practical value of past experiences for future choices. Moreover, even when large platforms provide extensive databases and aggregated reviews, their interaction model generally prioritizes one-off utility—navigation, ranking, and search—rather than the structured preservation of personal history and the social context that makes recommendations credible.

Therefore, the central pain addressed by Noma is not merely “finding restaurants,” but rather the absence of a user-centric system that captures experiences as an evolving personal and social archive, enabling users to retrieve past references efficiently and to discover new places through trusted, relationship-based signals.

### What Noma Delivers

Noma operates as a gastronomy-focused social network that combines structured memory with social discovery. Users can authenticate, browse and search venues, access place detail pages (specific informations of a certain place), publish and manage reviews, save and favorite places, create lists for different intents, follow other users, and view activity in a feed, while also accessing personal statistics that summarize behavioral patterns over time. Because trust is a decisive factor in gastronomy, the product is designed to elevate peer-driven signals and socially grounded recommendations, thereby reducing dependence on anonymous content and enabling discovery through people whose preferences users already understand.

Furthermore, Noma is intentionally structured to create value for establishments, since authentic user activity can translate into visibility, engagement, and top-of-mind recall; consequently, the platform supports localized partnership experiments that remain economically feasible even at early scale.

### Goals, Milestones, and Evidence of Success

Noma’s business plan is anchored in entrepreneurial validation, in which technical delivery and market learning advance together. Accordingly, the primary goals are: (i) to validate that users perceive meaningful value in a social, memory-oriented gastronomy platform and that they repeatedly engage with core actions such as saving, favoriting, reviewing, following, and list-building; (ii) to validate a low-risk monetization pathway through B2B partnerships, demonstrating willingness to pay for promoted visibility within a localized market; and (iii) to establish acquisition and retention loops driven by social sharing, activity visibility, and habit-forming statistics, thereby enabling expansion beyond the initial geography once the model is stabilized.

Success is evaluated through early retention and engagement benchmarks, low acquisition costs, sustainable unit economics for B2B revenue, and consistent qualitative signals indicating strong acceptance and clarity of value proposition.

## Market Landscape and Demand Validation

### Sector Dynamics and Behavioral Trends

The food and hospitality sector continues to experience strong digital mediation, driven by smartphones, location-based services, and social behavior; however, this shift is not explained solely by convenience, since it is increasingly anchored in trust formation and social proof. In this sense, market evidence collected and published by the BrightLocal communication channel in 2025 indicates that online recommendations have reached a level of credibility comparable to traditional interpersonal sources: in the 2025 survey results, 42% of consumers stated that they trust consumer reviews as much as personal recommendations from friends and family, which reinforces that digital content is no longer perceived merely as “information,” but rather as a legitimate input for decision-making. At the same time, BrightLocal’s 2025 data shows a clear hierarchy of trust signals, because only 29% of consumers reported trusting consumer reviews as much as recommendations from social media influencers, thereby suggesting that peer-like validation and socially proximate credibility remain structurally more persuasive than influencer-driven persuasion. Consequently, a platform that combines discovery with persistent memory and socially trusted context is positioned to address a structural gap left by generalist solutions, since it aligns with the most trusted behavioral drivers—namely, authentic peer signals and the ability to recall and compare experiences over time—rather than depending on purely promotional dynamics.

### Audience Definition and User Archetypes

Noma’s primary segment consists of urban consumers aged approximately 20 to 45 who frequently visit restaurants, bars, cafés, and similar venues and who demonstrate high digital adoption and social activity. While this segment values discovery, it also exhibits a recurring friction: references are saved informally and later lost, which reveals a practical need for structured recall and organization. Psychographically, the platform targets users who prioritize authenticity and relevance and who prefer recommendations rooted in trusted circles rather than purely anonymous aggregation.

In parallel, Noma’s early-stage commercial segment includes restaurants and cafés that seek differentiated digital presence and closer engagement with local communities, particularly in markets where measurable exposure and credibility can be built through authentic user behavior.

### Market Potential (National → City → Early Capture)

Noma’s sizing follows a top-down structure that contextualizes opportunity and anchors early-stage goals in defensible assumptions.

**Total Potential (Brazil).** The total number of people who frequently visit bars and restaurants in Brazil can be approximated by applying a 93% frequency rate to the national population of 214 million:

- **Total Potential = 214,000,000 × 0.93 = 199,020,000 people**

**Initial Reachable Market (São Paulo).** The initial operational focus is the city of São Paulo, with 11.45 million inhabitants, applying the same rate:

- **Initial Reachable Market = 11,450,000 × 0.93 = 10,648,500 people (~10.64 million)**

**Year-1 Target Capture.** For the first year, a conservative adoption target of 0.5% is assumed, reflecting the early-stage nature of the platform and the reliance on organic growth:

- **Year-1 Target = 10,648,500 × 0.005 = 53,242.5 (~53,200 active users)**

Because the market entry is intentionally localized, these estimates provide strategic justification while, simultaneously, setting realistic early objectives that can be validated through real usage.

### Competitive Context and White Space

Noma competes in a landscape shaped by both indirect and direct competitors. **Google Maps** and **Tripadvisor** are dominant indirect competitors due to scale and review volume; nevertheless, they prioritize navigation, rankings, and utility-driven search rather than structured personal memory and socially contextualized discovery. **Beli**, as a more direct gastronomy-oriented competitor, emphasizes ratings and personal taste tracking, yet its limited penetration in Brazil and reduced emphasis on robust social feed dynamics constrain its relevance for the initial local thesis.

Therefore, Noma’s strategic white space lies in combining gastronomy as the primary domain with social context as the trust mechanism and persistent personal history as a core product asset, thereby creating a differentiated experience that does not depend on competing on scale at the outset.

### Strategic Diagnosis (SWOT)

**Strengths.** A differentiated value proposition centered on personal and social memory, supported by an MVP, modern architecture, and a localized entry strategy that increases signal-to-noise during validation.  
**Weaknesses.** Limited brand recognition and a dependency on network effects, since perceived value increases with social graph density and content volume.  
**Opportunities.** Growth in experience-driven digital behavior and a clear gap in structured recall and trusted peer-driven discovery, particularly in dense urban markets.  
**Threats.** Feature replication by incumbents, evolving privacy regulations, and platform-policy constraints that may affect distribution and growth.

## Commercial Strategy and Go-To-Market Design

### Positioning and Messaging

Noma is positioned as a social and experience-centric gastronomy platform that prioritizes trust, personal history, and community interaction. While generalist platforms optimize for one-time utility, Noma emphasizes long-term recall and socially grounded discovery, thereby aligning with users who seek authenticity and recurring engagement rather than purely transactional interactions.

### Launch Blueprint (São Paulo First)

Noma’s market entry is designed as a controlled rollout that emphasizes validation, iteration, and progressive scale. The initial focus on São Paulo is justified not only by population and digital adoption, but also by venue density; moreover, according to Abrasel, the state of São Paulo concentrates more than **150,000 active food establishments**, which reinforces the region as the most strategic environment for early experimentation and partnership formation.

Therefore, the launch will combine a soft rollout with targeted community activation, leveraging social sharing, curated content, and selective partnerships with venues to build credibility and traction. In addition, the geographic constraint improves measurement fidelity, enabling faster iteration and more disciplined monetization experiments, which reduces execution risk while maximizing learning.

### Acquisition Mechanics

Acquisition is intentionally designed around low-cost and community-driven channels in order to preserve unit economics during validation. Consequently, growth efforts prioritize word-of-mouth, social sharing mechanisms embedded in the product, and localized exposure through partnerships with restaurants and gastronomy communities. Moreover, highly targeted digital outreach may be applied selectively within São Paulo to accelerate learning cycles without committing to broad paid acquisition prematurely.

### Retention and Engagement Loops

Retention is primarily driven by social visibility and by the accumulation of personal value over time. Specifically, as users publish reviews, save places, curate lists, and follow others, their activity becomes both personally meaningful and socially shareable, thereby reinforcing identity, recognition, and trusted discovery loops. In parallel, the statistics layer converts experiences into self-reflection—revealing patterns such as preferred categories and visited distributions—which encourages habitual use even when users are not actively searching for a new venue. Consequently, these mechanisms reduce churn by transforming isolated actions into an ongoing narrative.

### Monetization Logic and Pricing Architecture

In the short term, monetization is intentionally conservative and centered on B2B validation, thereby maintaining frictionless adoption for end users while creating an early revenue path. The initial pricing assumption is **R$ 300 per restaurant per month** for promoted visibility or sponsored placement, which is accessible enough to test willingness to pay while, simultaneously, enabling break-even with a limited number of partners.

In the medium term, the revenue model can expand into tiered subscriptions for establishments, user-facing premium features, and partnership-driven transaction revenue (e.g., reservations or curated experiences). In the long term, diversification may include loyalty and cashback integrations and broader strategic alliances, provided that the core engagement thesis is validated through real usage.

## Operating Model and Delivery Capability

### How the Product Operates in Practice

Noma’s operating model focuses on enabling discovery, experience capture, and social interaction with minimal friction. Users authenticate, search and browse, view place details, publish reviews and ratings, save and favorite venues, curate lists, and follow others, while the feed supports continuous discovery through socially contextualized activities. For establishments, the early operational model emphasizes partnership onboarding for promoted visibility within São Paulo, enabling measurable campaigns without requiring complex integrations in the validation stage.

### Technology Foundation

The MVP is implemented through a client–server architecture, with a React Native application as the presentation layer, a NestJS backend for business logic and API exposure, and PostgreSQL for transactional persistence. Firebase Authentication supports secure identity flows, while JWT-based authorization enables stateless request validation. Moreover, Docker-based containerization and deployment on Render improve environment consistency and operational simplicity, while Firebase Cloud Messaging enables push notifications that can be progressively leveraged to strengthen engagement as retention loops mature.

### Organization, Roles, and Governance

During validation, Noma follows a founder-led model that reduces overhead and accelerates iteration; nevertheless, as the platform scales, roles in product and UX, backend and infrastructure, partnerships and community, and analytics-driven growth become progressively relevant. In addition, governance practices—especially those related to privacy controls, content moderation, and compliance—should evolve from lightweight safeguards into formal policies as user base and content volume increase.

## Financial Model and Viability Outlook

### Validation-Stage Economics

Noma’s short-term financial model is designed to minimize downside through low fixed costs and early break-even feasibility. Monthly operating costs are estimated between **R$ 500 and R$ 800**, with an average assumption of **R$ 650**, reflecting infrastructure and essential services.

With a conservative B2B price of **R$ 300 per restaurant per month**, break-even is:

- **Break-even = 650 / 300 ≈ 2.17**, which implies **three paying restaurants** sustain operations.

A Year-1 validation scenario with five paying restaurants yields:

- **Monthly revenue = 5 × 300 = R$ 1,500**
- **Annual revenue = 1,500 × 12 = R$ 18,000**
- **Annual costs = 650 × 12 = R$ 7,800**
- **Operating result (Year 1) = 18,000 − 7,800 = R$ 10,200**

Therefore, the model supports early sustainability while preserving flexibility to reinvest in growth once hypotheses are validated.

### Feasibility Assessment

**Technical feasibility** is supported by mature technologies and modular architecture, while testing and usability validation reduce regression risk and strengthen maintainability. **Operational feasibility** is reinforced by managed services and a lean model that keeps costs predictable during validation. **Market feasibility** is supported by the convergence of behavior trends around reviews and trust in peer recommendations, together with consistent qualitative acceptance signals from academic and social communities.

## Expansion Path and Strategic Options

### Medium-Term Path (Scaling Within Brazil)

In the medium term, scaling depends on validated engagement loops and predictable B2B revenue, which enable selective investments in marketing, infrastructure, and partnerships. Consequently, expansion beyond the initial geography should occur only after retention and monetization metrics meet predefined thresholds, thereby reducing the risk of scaling instability.

### Long-Term Path (Ecosystem and Partnerships)

In the long term, Noma may expand into loyalty and cashback integrations, curated experiences, and strategic partnerships; moreover, an alternative strategic route—raised during evaluation—includes offering Noma as a private-label solution for large gastronomy platforms, thereby enabling B2B2C distribution while preserving the core product thesis, provided that market evidence supports the pivot.

## Closing Perspective

This business plan consolidates a differentiated product thesis, a disciplined market-entry strategy, and a validation-stage financial model that favors sustainability over premature scale. Although the platform has not yet launched commercially, the existence of a functional MVP, a robust technical foundation, and early break-even feasibility supports the conclusion that Noma is positioned for a controlled São Paulo launch and for progressive scaling as engagement and monetization hypotheses are confirmed through real-world operation.
