# Public Report - Module 1

## Executive Summary

This project aims to create a niche social network for bars and restaurants, allowing users to share dining experiences, rate establishments, and follow personalized recommendations. Inspired by the Letterboxd model, the platform offers an interactive environment where users can follow friends, influencers, and industry experts to receive more relevant and personalized suggestions. Additionally, the platform enables bars and restaurants to strategically position themselves, fostering authentic engagement with their customers.

## Problem Statement

Discovering bars and restaurants today is a fragmented and inefficient process. Traditional platforms offer generic ratings, making it difficult for users to find recommendations that truly align with their preferences. Moreover, there is an overload of poorly contextualized reviews, complicating the decision-making process on where to eat and drink.

With the increasing value placed on personalization, there is a clear gap in the market for a solution that offers more relevant recommendations, based on the opinions of people the user trusts.

### Module Development

### Sprint 1 - Project Structuring

In this initial sprint, the focus was on establishing the project's foundational structure. This involved organizing the scope, objectives, and main assumptions through the creation of a detailed Project Plan and the development of the Project Charter (TAPI). Defining these elements early was critical to ensure that all subsequent activities would remain aligned with the project's overall vision, reducing ambiguity and providing a clear path for execution.

### Sprint 2 - Problem Exploration and Benchmarking

The second sprint concentrated on deepening the understanding of the market context. Through defining the TAM, SAM, and SOM, the market opportunity was quantitatively framed. Mapping competitive differentiators and benchmarking both direct and indirect competitors helped to identify gaps and opportunities in the market. This groundwork was essential to ensure the platform would be built with clear strategic positioning, addressing unmet needs rather than replicating existing solutions.

- Mapping of competitive differentiators

- Benchmark analysis of direct and indirect competitors

### Sprint 3 - Market Validation and Strategic Modeling

Building on the market analysis, this sprint focused on validating strategic assumptions through robust analytical frameworks. By applying Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT analysis, and developing a Risk Matrix and Blue Ocean Strategy Matrix, a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape and potential threats was obtained. These analyses were vital to guide strategic decision-making and to identify potential areas for innovation and competitive advantage.

### Sprint 4 - Value Proposition and Monetization

The fourth sprint shifted the focus toward the customer, refining the platform’s value proposition. Through the Value Proposition Canvas, the specific pains, gains, and needs of the target users were detailed. Additionally, different monetization strategies were analyzed for short, medium, and long-term implementation. These activities were crucial to ensure that the platform not only delivers value to users but also has a sustainable business model aligned with its growth objectives.

- Development of the Value Proposition Canvas

### Sprint 5 — Business Plan and Roadmap

The final sprint of the module focused on synthesizing all previous findings into a cohesive and actionable Business Plan. KPIs (key performance indicators) were defined to monitor the platform’s performance and ensure accountability for results. Finally, the project’s Roadmap was developed, providing a strategic timeline with prioritized milestones, ensuring an organized progression from ideation to MVP launch and beyond.

## Next Steps

For the next module, the focus will be on developing the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), prioritizing the creation of essential user experience features such as profile creation, bar and restaurant registration, review systems, and a personalized recommendation feed.

Additionally, usability tests with real users will be conducted to validate hypotheses generated during the ideation phase, along with initial preparations for the user acquisition strategy.
