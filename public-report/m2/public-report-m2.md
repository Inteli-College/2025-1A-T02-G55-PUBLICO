### Module 2: From Concept to a Functional MVP

**Sprint 6: Project Definition and User-Centric Planning**

This initial stage was dedicated to establishing the foundational requirements for the Noma social network. The core focus was to translate the initial idea into a structured plan by developing detailed user stories and mapping out critical user journeys. This user-centric approach ensured that all subsequent design and development efforts were aligned with solving real user needs and providing tangible value.

**Sprint 7: Visual Conception and Prototyping**

With the user requirements defined, this sprint focused on translating abstract user flows into a tangible visual blueprint. Low-fidelity wireframes were created for all key screens of the application. This process was crucial for validating the proposed navigation, information architecture, and overall layout, allowing for rapid iteration and feedback before committing to high-fidelity design or code development.

**Sprint 8: Technical Architecture and System Design**

This sprint was focused on designing the technical backbone of the Noma platform. Key decisions were made regarding the technology stack, including **React Native** for the cross-platform mobile frontend and **NestJS (with Prisma and PostgreSQL)** for the scalable backend. The database schema and the API contract were designed to ensure a clear separation of concerns and to build a robust, secure, and maintainable foundation for the MVP.

**Sprint 9: Backend Implementation and API Construction**

The focus of this sprint shifted to building the server-side of the application. The designed architecture was brought to life by developing the core backend modules in NestJS, setting up the database schema with Prisma migrations, and implementing the REST API endpoints. The main goal was to create a functional and secure API capable of handling all core operations, such as user management, place information, and review submissions.

**Sprint 10: Frontend Development and User Interface Implementation**

In this final sprint, the frontend of the Noma application was developed, bringing the project's visual and interactive elements to life. The wireframes and UI designs were implemented in React Native, resulting in a fully navigable and responsive user interface. This stage involved building the complete component library and setting up navigation, establishing a client-side foundation ready for future backend integration.
